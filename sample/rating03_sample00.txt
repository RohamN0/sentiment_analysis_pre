i wanted a modern system that i could use as an alarm for unwanted entry. this system is designed as a lead in to an active monitoring contract. i know people that are glad to have that and would not want it any other way. i however did not want an active monitoring contract, i just wanted a system that i could monitor myself and give my wife a panic button when i was away. a lot of features that are touted in the ad are not available without active monitoring. just so you know. also i had to call and get special permission to turn off the error message telling me that i had not activated my monitoring contract. i signed up for the web site but there is nothing there for a non-monitored customer.
