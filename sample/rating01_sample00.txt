this item looks great on paper but it did not live up to the billing in practice. i do not think my particular home network is all that unusual (a few laptops, a desktop, a tivo and a roku) but the wd just could not handle it. i spent a few hours (on two separate days) working with their tech support folks but the darn thing never worked right. too bad, i really like the idea of having my own "cloud."
