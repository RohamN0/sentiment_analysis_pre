i bought these for my senn hd 598s because both cables that come with it are frustratingly too short and too long if you get my meaning. i got the 1.5m as a happy medium and love it. the cable itself is a little stiff but seems fine. the little spring thing at one end looks like it will prolly break/separate after awhile but not a big deal if you do not pinch the cable. so yeah. it is cheap, fits my senns, & does what it says it will. also, it looks cool so there is that.
