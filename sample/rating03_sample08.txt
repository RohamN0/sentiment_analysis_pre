been using this macbook pro cover for nearly 4 years. i eventually took the bottom cover piece off since i felt the heat from the laptop needed more cooling and the cover was hindering that. plus the bottom piece came up right by the part where your wrist would rest around the trackpad, and it would constantly scratch the bottom of my wrist. over time, i guess the cover has done what it is supposed to (protect the laptop from minor bangs and nicks) but the cover has already started chipping off, especially in the corners. i will notice a crack, and before long, a small piece has come off. the color is more turquoise/aqua. it is done it is job and my macbook pro is still running perfectly great, so i may just upgrade the cover to a rubberized one, or not use one at all anymore.
