i bought this for a friend's elderly grandmother and it broke within the first 8 months. no big deal because it was still under warranty and was easily replaced by the manufacturer. six more months go by and the replacement also breaks. now it is over the year warranty on the original so the manufacturer will not replace it again. i can see one going bad in a year, it happens, but two going bad in just over a year makes this garbage in my opinion. it is fine that they will not replace it again, because i am going with a different brand.
