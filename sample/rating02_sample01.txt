surprisingly bulky! it takes up more space than anticipated in my laptop case. i also did not like that i had to use the plastic cover piece otherwise it would be unstable after plugging it in. the more i use that part as instructed as a balance, the more i see it getting worn out from inserting and removing it all the time. it will not last much longer...
