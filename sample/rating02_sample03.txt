the positive: i like how slim this casing is. the rubbery texture is also very comfortable to hold. the negative: its not compatible with surface dock connector. i have an external monitor / keyboard / mouse setup. so i pretty much let the casing lay flat without deploying the kickstand. when the kickstand is not deployed, the surface dock connector cannot be fully inserted. unless cut off a little bit of the plastic which i will do later so that the surface dock connector works with case.
