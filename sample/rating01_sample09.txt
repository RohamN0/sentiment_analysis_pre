as a tripod, it works. it holds your camera, moves around as one would expect, extends in height, etc. so while it works and there is nothing wrong with this tripod, it just is not up for anything more demanding than a light camera sitting atop inside a room with no direct contact. for most people looking to throw their point-and-shoot camera on top for videos of birthdays or what have you and not touch it at all, it will work just like any other tripod, but once a dslr or other larger camera is mounted, any physical interaction happens with the camera while filming, or the wind blows, the rigidity of this tripod simply is awful. basically, unless you plan on setting up your camera, hitting the record button, and walking away, this tripod is not for video use. for photo purposes, i continually found myself frustrated by the flexing and twisting that occurs when adjusting the camera position, even with the legs completely collapsed. nearly every shot that i tried to setup for would take ages to dial in with all of the readjusting i would have to do to counteract the spring-back of simply moving the camera. with the adjustment screws tightened just enough to keep the camera from adjusting itself, i still had issues with the entire tripod twisting and flexing when making adjustments to where the camera was pointed. it was frustrating me to the point where it was either shooting by hand, or not shooting at all. the bottom line is that it is not rigid enough for nearly anything, especially if you are using it for video or anything outdoors. it works as a tripod, but the effective usability of it is almost 0. i wish i spent the extra money for something a bit more sturdy which can be easily attained by other options for less than $50 usd.
