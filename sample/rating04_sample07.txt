the material on the cover seems very durable & has a nice texture to it. i like that the part of the case that houses the tablet is a tpu case that covers the whole edges, with the exception of all ports & speakers. 2 things keeps this from being a 5-star review. it is not magnetic. i do not care about it not being a smart case but being magnetic would keep it from flying open whenever it feel like it. also, the material around the s-pen port comes right up to it so unless you have skinny fingers, there may be a bit of a challenge getting the s-pen out. otherwise, great case.
