&nbsp;should be awesome. not. check out this video. i am using a samsung galaxy 8. it sounds great - until the 4g is turned on. sorry guys, someone dropped the ball. i had to rig it with a 1ft trrs extension cable and some creativity just to hope that the hummmm will go away. great mic with no internet on, but no skyping like this. ouchy!
