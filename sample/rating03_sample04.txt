this laptop is great. msi is a great company, although their support is lacking, a lot. the keyboard powered by steelseries is incredibly cool. you have full control over the colors and can specify when they turn on for certain programs, etc. edit: three years later the mousepad buttons do not work properly anymore. they actually do work, but they do not do what they are assigned to do. i have been told it is a hardware issue.
