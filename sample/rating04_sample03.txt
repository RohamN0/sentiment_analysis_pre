awesome performing card, just not an awesome price lol. pro: runs silent when not under load. this is because by default the fans do not run unless the gpu temp hits 60c or higher (max safe temps are in upper 80c so this is perfectly fine and will not lower the lifespan of the card. plus if you are spending this much do you really see yourself the type to not buy another one in 3+ yeas?) also auto boost to 1400mhz+ on the core without me doing anything. con: stupid expensive, especially with pascal around the corner. my first one came defective. when it would boost it would randomly crash the driver. got a replacement, it seems to use less voltage, auto boost higher and does not crash. my card does not seem to have any overclocking headroom, but it auto boost over 1400mhz on the core and i am sure that is one reason that it is already running so high. i hear many people can hit 1500mhz easy but i do not want to increase voltages. the memory i can only over clock a little and it starts to crash. so cannot hit the 8000mhz some others can which is a bummer since for me the memory bumping gave better fps vs. core on games like bf4. i have this in an sg13 case. fits perfect. so i have an itx gaming rig now with a 6700k, 32gb ddr4 and an 980ti (top of the line gaming rig basically) that is supper small and very quiet thanks to the cards fan design. for those that do not like the fan setting of off till 60c, just flip the bios switch to the second bios. that one is pre-programmed to run all the time and also has some higher power limits (not voltage). i wish these had lifetime warranty still like in the old days with evga but like all other good things, that came to an end. on the upside they have stepup which hopefully if pascal comes out soon i can maybe use but doubt it. seems to be very power efficient also fwiw. i have a 750w psu and with the card and my whole rig at full load i just break 400w.. so gone are the days of needing stupid powerful psu.
