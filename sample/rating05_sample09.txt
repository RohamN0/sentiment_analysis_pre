i have had my acer tablet for about a week now and i love it !! if you are an artist like myself and on a tight budget that you can quite afford an ipad pro, surface pro, or even think about affording a cintiq i think this is the best option. the 10.1" screen size gives you enough space to draw and there are many excellent art apps to use such as painter, art rage, sketchbook, artflow, etc. just to name a few. many of the previous users commented about in the low memory notification and i do have that too but it does not seem to affect the performance of the tablet. i did install a few apps i had on my s3 phone like cm cleaner, cm speed booster, etc. to see if that helps at all. umm... my suggestion is to not remove the clear screen protector that is on the tablet when you take it out ta the box. even though there is a sticker tab that says remove after application i would keep it on for protection purposes. i find no major issues with this tablet at all and think it is a great buy for the price !! i plan to expand the memory with a 128gb micro sd card. but overall i highly recommend this tablet if you are in the market for a decent tablet for on the go use.
