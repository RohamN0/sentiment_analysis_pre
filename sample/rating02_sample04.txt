when on easily enough but the camera hole and i do not really care to test if this effect the camera because i do not plan on using it anyway. the top right of the protector refuses to stick on to the device leaving just a big pocket of air trapped their. why two stars for such minor issues? honestly, i feel this is such a simple thing i should not even have to review it. when you spend $10 on a screen protector vs the chintzy $3 multipacks you can buy you want it to easily replace all three. this will not last, the adhesive has already given up on the top right and slowly this will expand and just fall off. there are so many options for these that i would not settle with mediocre quality. in the future i will be purchasing from someone else and will not buy from moko for any of my many other devices. i suggest you do the same.
