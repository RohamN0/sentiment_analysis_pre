mount seems ok but the screws provided did not fit samsung tv. samsung is most common tv and i am surprised m8 screws provided were too big in length. also, it did not include enough spacers to fit the screw size. i also did not get the magnet for handing locks to be hidden behind the tv. i tried contacting customer service, either it just keeps ringing and eventually auto hangs up or i get busy tone. i tried at least 10times via cell phone and work #. nothing worked.
