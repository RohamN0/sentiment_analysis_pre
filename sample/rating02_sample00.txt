here's the tldr: if you want a mic that will pick up everything within a hundred feet of you with crystal clear sound, this is for you. but if you want anything directional or with noise cancellation, then look elsewhere. i came here looking for a unidirectional mic or an omnidirectional mic with settings i could change. in the title it says omnidirectional, but down in the bottom description, and here's where the problem is, the mic is described as directivity: unidirectional. there sales department might want to change that. and one note about their tech support people. i emailed in to ask if, yes or no, did the mic have any unidirectional capabilities? and got a long-winded email about how to limit all the noise in my environment. everything from turning off my ac and putting a blanket over my computer to turning off my refrigerator. no joke. an annoying, beat-around-the-bush style response. in summary: as a room-scale mic, it is fantastic. it picks up noises you will not even hear. but it gets one star from me because of the completely misleading product description. many mics are able to change their direction through settings, this one does not.
