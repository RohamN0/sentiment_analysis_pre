i am extremely pleased with this ipad air 2 case. my ipad air 2 fits snugly and i love how deep the grooves are in the cover when you use it as a stand. i have had other cases similar to this one, but the grooves were very shallow and the tablet ended up falling down. you will not go wrong with this case and the price is exceptional. i was concerned the color i ordered might be a bit bright, i ordered the deep purple, but it was a perfect shade. very, very happy with this purchase.
