yes, it fits the power connection on celestron nexstar scopes like c4 se and c8 se. but the "securing screw" head is nearly impossible to turn with human fingers! cannot get it to secure on either my c4 se or my c8 se. the problem is that if it is not secured then any movement by the rotating base of the scope (or any other accidental tug on the cable) results in the plug coming out and the scope powering off. aaaargh ! celestron, you can do better !
