i bought two of these mounts for two computer monitors and have been mostly happy. the build quality is very strong -- they are heavy-duty and sturdy. i do have two complaints (hence the 3 stars): first, two of the mounting screws broke (heads snapped off) while installing. fortunately i had backups, but this was annoying. secondly, the mounts move side-to-side well, but there is no up and down ability. i have had to remount them twice, just to adjust a half-inch or so.
