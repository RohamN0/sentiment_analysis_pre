i received my case today and the case feels pretty sturdy. while installing the case you need to remove the rubber and release the hard plastic case. the rubber was very soft and i am a little worry it may stretch over time. the case also includes a kick stand but it feels a little flimsy. overall, i was a bit disappointed with the quality on the kickstand because i intended to use it to prop to watch movies. however, the stand does function. i would recommend taking caution be gently when propping the stand out of case. i was given an opportunity to review this product for a reduce price. this review was based on my experience and honest opinion.
