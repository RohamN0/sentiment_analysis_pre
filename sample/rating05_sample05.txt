i have been using this micro hdmi to hdmi cable for years. i use it to connect my lenovo laptop to my viewsonic monitor. the setup requires an hdmi to dvi adapter, but they are easy to find. i recently moved and somehow the cable got lost. i did not hesitate to look through my amazon order history and click buy again for this item.
