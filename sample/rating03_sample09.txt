i freely admit that i should have taken note before making the purchase, but have found that the cord is way too short. this length might be appropriate for a laptop, but for at least, most desktop applications, it is not long enough. of more import, the buttons on top do not disable the usb, they only cut the power. i wanted to be able to totally disable the device connected, without having to unplug it. so, the buttons, in my opinion, are mostly worthless. i cannot personally think of a situation where i would need a device connected but without power. the product is solid, works well within it is intended use i suppose, but some care needs to be taken to understand its drawbacks.
