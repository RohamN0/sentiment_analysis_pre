came without the sand bags instead i got a background support thats loose on both ends. i had to tighten the stands up with my socket wrenches to get them to support my lights whoever assembled them did a poor job. these stands are not as good as made out to be in the other reviews. the knobs feel plastic even though they are listed as metal. i would get some impact stands before getting these they are big pos's. they would be ok for small led lights but i would not trust them with anything over a few lbs then you extend them they are very flimsy and seem unstable.
