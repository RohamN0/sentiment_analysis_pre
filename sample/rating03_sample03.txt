*edit - used it more now. the mic really stinks. siri cannot understand what i am saying when i try and text. she gets like 1/3 of the words. anyone leaving a poor review over the sound quality is expecting way too much for the price here. here's what i can tell you it sounds decent. the suction cup has not had any issues for me. it is been up for a week. the reason i got this one is because the lower-priced one that i had does not let you make bluetooth commands. this one does. so you can text or ask siri questions while you are in the shower. of course it would be better if it had a better speaker/microphone. but i would not expect that at this price. it is decent and it does a good job for what we are paying here.
