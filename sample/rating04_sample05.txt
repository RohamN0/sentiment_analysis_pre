my 70 mustang has a tape deck i will not replace so i ordered this to use my iphone in the car. it kept reversing in the deck so it would not work at first. i used a large flat screwdriver to break off the drive gear on each of the cassette gears. now it works great for me and i can listen to my itunes.
