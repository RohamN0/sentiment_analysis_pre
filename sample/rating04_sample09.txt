the charge time and duration of running time seem similar to the oem battery. the rated power of this battery is different compared to the original nikon battery as shown in the picture, i am not sure if that is going to be completely safe for the electronics of my $3k+ camera body or not. it is a good value so long as the case does not bulge with time as i have had happen with another aftermarket battery, and the difference in electrical values is safe for the camera. that is something i do not know enough about. it would be nice if the manufacturer of this battery can speak up with more details about this.
