these speaker cables are getting harder to find being that a lot of the home stereo receivers are "all in one" units these days. fortunately amazon still supplies these cables for stereo components and speakers sold separately. what is even more fantastic is that these come two in a pack with the plugs color coded to verify the left and right channels for super easy identification and hookups. highly recommend this product to all of those still preserving those vintage stereo components. these will also work great on console stereos that allow external speakers to be connected providing the console stereo units have the rca speaker jacks, as some will have the screw type terminals, however, if your speaker has the rca jack on the back, simply reverse the cable for easy connecting.
