i have used about a half dozen add-on bluetooth receivers in cars. this has been by far the best for ease of use and audio quality. usually i need to pick up a ground loop isolator to use in the car as the whine from the alternator will drive me crazy. not with the firefly, this just works and there is not any buzzing/whining at all. multiple device pairing works fine, i think it is a fifo sort of arrangement, i.e. if you reach the device limit it will delete the oldest when pairing another device. i go through devices quickly and tend to pair a new one every month or two. have not had any issues. the usb plug blinks when looking to connect and stays on when connected. not too bright, but bright enough to be a little distracting depending on the cabin configuration of a vehicle. the audio cable is short which is a plus for me, an extension is included.
