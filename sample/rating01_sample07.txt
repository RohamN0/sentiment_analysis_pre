these extension tubes are very tight fitting. the side that attaches to your lens is metal, and is a struggle to attach & detach, but doable. but the side that attaches to your camera is plastic and just as difficult to attach/detach. so after a few months of light use, the plastic docking attachment has broken/crumbled. i am lucky that none of the broken pieces fell into my camera. i previously purchased a set of opteka extension tubes that has metal on both connections and they work great, but were not available for my current camera. i will be looking for a new set that has metal connections on both ends of the extension tubes to replace these.
