i bought this to use an aftermarket head unit with a 2004 prius with jbl amplifier and nav unit, and it worked great! no issues, hooked up on the first try, we did not even need to adjust the pot. unfortunately, the two supposed 2004 prius harnesses we tried first did not work: if you have a jbl amp, do not bother with the cheap ones, tyto-01 is the adapter you need to make it work. as others have noted, the description photo on amazon as of the writing of this review (the slightly rounded box with the rca plugs) is an older version; the 2017 revision i received in jan 2018 uses the eight amplified speaker-out wires and attenuates them, and has no rca jacks. note: this did not include the 68 ohm resistor necessary to make the nav unit work after the stock head unit is removed, but one is supplied with metra 99-8213 kit if you also order that; otherwise, you will need to order one separately. there is a note in the instructions that you must connect the blue/white "amplifier on" wire, but no instructions on what to do if your head unit does not have an amplifier on signal: we spliced the blue/white (amp on) wire to the spare red (ignition-switched +12v) wire which turns the amp on whenever the car is on, which seems to work fine with this model year prius (no odd noises or anything when the amp is on but head unit is off).
