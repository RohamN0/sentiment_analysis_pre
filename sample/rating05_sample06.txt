excellent product. i went on a week long motorcycle trip with a friend and we wanted a way to download the gopro video we were shooting so we would not have to take dozens of sd cards each. our first solution was a laptop but that seemed like it was going to be a pain in addition to taking up too much valuable space on the bikes. i instead went with this drive. it was easy to set up and all you had to do was insert the sd card into the drive and it automatically downloaded the videos. we could do it over lunch, at the end of the day, or just stick it in a saddlebag and let it run. great solution with plenty of capacity.
