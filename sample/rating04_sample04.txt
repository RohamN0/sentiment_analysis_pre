strap works great. i floated my camera in an aquarium for over two hours without problem. float dried out quickly. also took swimming in a local pool and it worked great. one negative was that the snap on the strap was too tight to allow for me to snap the strap on my wrist. for reference my wrist circumference is 7.5 inches. camera was a nikon coolpix s33, which weighs close to 8 ounces.
